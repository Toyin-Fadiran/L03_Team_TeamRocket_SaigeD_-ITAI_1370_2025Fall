Daily Log of Collaboration: 

Day 1 (WED October 1) -- Inaugural Teams Meeting: Scratch Project Discussion 

Brainstormed and gathered requirements to implement a Snake-inspired video game, named Taco Mania! 

In said video game, our team built a program where the player uses keypad controls to collect taco ingredients placed along the kitchen play area, while taking care to avoid dangerous obstacles and the edges 

Set up a TEAM WORKING AGREEMENT (shared expectations as a team): 

Rule 1: Please make sure to contribute in a timely manner and communicate with your teammates and your leads! 

Rule 2: Meet every day at 8 pm CST for a daily stand up (each member outlines what they did yesterday, what they are doing today, and blockers or issues one is facing) 

Set up each Group Member’s Roles 

Toyin Fadiran – Lead Documenter (notes, screenshots, README/reporting) 

Saide D – Lead Character and BG Design (implemented movement & collision logic) 

Ranveer – Lead Programmer (sprites, UI, and visuals) 

Clinton – Lead Game Tester (bug fixes, QA) 

Taylor – Lead Sound Design 

Khuliso: Sound Design w/ Taylor 

 

 

 

Day 2 (THU October 2) -- Second Teams Meeting: Scratch Project Collaboration 

Program Design: Daily Stand-up focused primarily on enhancing Taco-themed video game  

Design idea 1: collect taco-related ingredients as your taco train/link grows with the more ingredients you collect ((Saige D/Ranveer) 

Place obstacles around the kitchen area (animals? People?) and if the user runs into the obstacle, they lose the game.  Also, if the user runs into edges of kitchen area (square box) going, game is instantly over (Saige D/ Ranveer) 

Scratch Login/ Password collaboration credentials shared for source code updates (Saige D)
